HDFS :: Hadoop Distributed File Systesm.  
-----------------------------------------
1. We can Treat HDFS as File System that can handle large datasets running on commodity hardware.
2. It's Open Source, but it's not scalable , adding nodes/hard drive process is slow and expensive.
3. When storing data in HDFS, you must budget for 3x the storage space that your data occupies.
4. HDFS has a significant advantage with read and write performance due to data locality. It can provide many times more read throughput than S3.
5. HDFS provides several options for data security, like kerberized user authentication and file system permission layers.
6. HDFS doesn’t give performance with storing small files, it will overload the name node with metadata and impact performance. 
    In addition, data stored on one cluster is not available on a different cluster.

S3 : Simple Storage Service
-----------------------------
1. S3 is an object storage, S3 is an object store, and therefore is not strictly used as a file system.
2. S3 is not open source, but it is auto - scalable , S3’s availability and durability is far superior to HDFS.
3. S3, AWS backs up the data automatically and the customer only pays for the data that needs to be stored instead of its replicas.
4. AWS gives you the ability to expand the cluster size to address issues with insufficient throughput.
5. S3 accesses and stores objects using the key/object relationship.
6. S3 storage cost is 5X cheaper than HDFS, if we include Human effort to maintain HDFS it will be 10X cheaper.
7. S3 is elastic, HDFS is not. S3 elasticity is pay-as-you-go pricing model.
